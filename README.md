### Concurrent Bugs & Known Issues üêõ

This is a list of known bugs that we have decided to set aside for now but need to be addressed in the future.

- **Homepage Post Visibility:** The `post_list` function on the homepage currently does not filter to include the current user's own posts, only posts from followed users.
- **Reaction Counters:** The reaction counters on the homepage are not always working correctly and may display a count of `0` even when a post has reactions. This is due to an inefficient database query.
